Here it is possible to find all the scripts
used to produce the excel sheet to import data in
protege.

To produce the output file "data.xlsx" run the
merge_main.R script after changing the dataset
folder (by default is pointing to the "data"
folder within this very same directory).

The data folder used during the project has to be
requested, if not already made available in the
project root.
